# Pong Game

This is an Office-themed old-school pong game! Officially titled "Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Pong for the Cure", the game resets the score and declares a winner at 5 points. As an added bonus, every time the ball hits the paddle Michael can be heard saying "That's what she said!".

The project was animated using JavaScript (includes paddle movement, ball movement, and score-keeping). Webpack was used to bundle the code.
